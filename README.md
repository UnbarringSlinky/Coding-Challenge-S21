I used Biopython to create the map. I used some of the code in the documentation from here: https://biopython-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/17%20-%20Graphics%20including%20GenomeDiagram.html

# ACM Research Coding Challenge (Spring 2021)

## No Collaboration Policy

**You may not collaborate with anyone on this challenge.** You _are_ allowed to use Internet documentation. If you _do_ use existing code (either from Github, Stack Overflow, or other sources), **please cite your sources in the README**.

## Submission Procedure

Please follow the below instructions on how to submit your answers.

1. Create a **public** fork of this repo and name it `ACM-Research-Coding-Challenge-S21`. To fork this repo, click the button on the top right and click the "Fork" button.
2. Clone the fork of the repo to your computer using `git clone [the URL of your clone]`. You may need to install Git for this (Google it).
3. Complete the Challenge based on the instructions below.
4. Submit your solution by filling out this [form](https://acmutd.typeform.com/to/uqAJNXUe).

## Question One

Genome analysis is the identification of genomic features such as gene expression or DNA sequences in an individual's genetic makeup. A genbank file (.gb) format contains information about an individual's DNA sequence. The following dataset in `Genome.gb` contains a complete genome sequence of Tomato Curly Stunt Virus. 

**With this file, create a circular genome map and output it as a JPG/PNG/JPEG format.** We're not looking for any complex maps, just be sure to highlight the features and their labels.

**You may use any programming language you feel most comfortable. We recommend Python because it is the easiest to implement. You're allowed to use any library you want to implement this**, just document which ones you used in this README file. Try to complete this as soon as possible.

Regardless if you can or cannot answer the question, provide a short explanation of how you got your solution or how you think it can be solved in your README.md file. However, we highly recommend giving the challenge a try, you just might learn something new!

I honestly feel I have answered the question and have provided a simple map, although throughout this process of creating this program I've learned that I don't quite understand what I am looking at when I see the picture. (With time and some help I'm positive I could understand it!)
If I had more of an understanding of what is important to have visualized, my program could allow for more of a complicated graph. The library Biopython is a very powerful tool that allows for all kinds
of data manipulation specifically made for Biology application. Because I feel that I have satisfied the requirements in the Readme and As stated "I should try and complete this ASAP" and "We're not looking for any complex maps"
I hope my program satisfies your needs!
